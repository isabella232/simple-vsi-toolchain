template.name: "Develop and Deploy application to VPC using deployment strategies"
template.description: "With this toolchain, you can develop an application and deploy to Virtual Server Instances (Virtual Machine) within your VPC managed by the IBM Cloud. This template provides you with choices of advanced deployment strategies like Blue-Green, Rolling to cater to your needs.  By default, the toolchain uses a sample Maven based Java \"Hello World\" app, but you can also bring your own Maven based Java app and link to it instead. This toolchain is configured with pipelines for continuous integration, continuous delivery and pull request with [Code Risk Analyzer](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-cd-configure-cra-repos), source control, issue tracking and online editing.\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected resource group or organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, follow the [tutorial](https://github.com/open-toolchain/sdk/wiki/Develop-and-deploy-an-application-on-IBM-Cloud-VPC-using-deployment-strategies)."
template.gettingStarted: " **Your toolchain is ready!**\n\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new build pipeline, which will be scanned for vulnerabilites and deployed in your Virtual Server. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-vsi) for this toolchain."

Create a new IBM Cloud API Key or use an existing IBM Cloud API Key to retrieve IBM Cloud VPC Infrastructure for the Continuous Delivery Pipeline to automate deployment of the built application binary to Virtual Machines within VPC."
deploy.blueGreen.longDescription: "**Blue-Green Strategy** leverage two permanent production environments (blue and green) with only one receiving traffic at any time. Deploy the new release to the idle environment, then switch all traffic to it with no downtime. For rapid rollback, simply switch all traffic back to the other environment that remained unchanged [Learn more](https://github.com/open-toolchain/sdk/wiki/Develop-and-deploy-an-application-on-IBM-Cloud-VPC-using-deployment-strategies#setup-deployment-target-for-blue-green).\n\nEnter a name for the app that you want to deploy.

deploy.rolling.longDescription: "**Rolling Strategy** deploys a new release with no downtime by incrementally updating all its instances in a rapid manner. Rollback requires redeploying the previous release, which may not be immediate [Learn more](https://github.com/open-toolchain/sdk/wiki/Develop-and-deploy-an-application-on-IBM-Cloud-VPC-using-deployment-strategies#setup-deployment-target-for-rolling).\n\nEnter a name for the app that you want to deploy. Create a new IBM Cloud API Key or use an existing IBM Cloud API Key to retrieve IBM Cloud VPC Infrastructure for the Continuous Delivery Pipeline to automate deployment of the built application binary to Virtual Machines within VPC."

For rapid rollback during progressive rollout, all traffic can be routed back to the original production environment [Learn more](https://github.com/open-toolchain/sdk/wiki/Develop-and-deploy-an-application-on-IBM-Cloud-VPC-using-deployment-strategies#setup-deployment-target-for-canary).\n\nEnter a name for the app that you want to deploy.
